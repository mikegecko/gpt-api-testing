                     BUGS
________________________________________________

    ❌ Can load into adventure route with invalid convo id's
    ❌ Radio buttons stay checked between tabs in new adventure
    ✅ I dont like how the sidebar on the dashboard jumps out when it first loads | Solved: AnimatePresence initialLoad={false}
    ❌ LLM loses context after truncation of long message chains, try adding system message back in as first message.
    ❌ Message history lost after truncation, use two arrays?
    ❌ LLM or server hangs when calling gpt functions sometimes
